## Configuration

Just use the auto discovery feature or add a thing for the binding manually
by providing host and port.
Initially a thing for the main zone will be created. This will trigger a zone
detection internally and all available additional zones will appear as new things.

## Features
The implemented channels are so far:

* `power`: Openhab Type `Switch`, Switches The Receiver ON or OFF.
	Your receiver has to be in network standby for this to work.
* `mute`: Openhab Type `Switch`, Mute or Unmute the receiver
* `volume`: Openhab Type `Dimmer`, Set's the receivers Volume percent Value.
* `input`: Openhab Type `String`, Set's the input selection, depends on your receiver's real inputs.
	Examples: HDMI1, HDMI2, AV4, TUNER, NET RADIO, etc. Those names can be changed
	on the receiver. A list of available inputs is fetched internally, but there is now way to
	make that available to sitemaps at the moment.
* `surroundProgram`: Openhab Type `String`, Set's the surround Mode
	Examples: 2ch Stereo, 7ch Stereo, Hall in Munic, Straight, Surround Decoder.
	A list of available modes is already defined but is not available for sitemaps
	at the moment due to openhab2 limitations.
 
## Example

    .items

     Switch Yamaha_Power         "Power [%s]"         <tv> 
     Dimmer Yamaha_Volume         "Volume [%.1f %%]"       
     Switch Yamaha_Mute             "Mute [%s]"            
     String Yamaha_Input         "Input [%s]"              
     String Yamaha_Surround         "surround [%s]"        
     Number Yamaha_NetRadio  "Net Radio" <netRadio> 
	 
	 # You have to link the items to the channels of your prefered zone e.g. in paperui after you've saved
	 # your items file.
 
     .sitemap

     Selection item=Yamaha_NetRadio label="Sender" mappings=[1="N Joy", 2="Radio Sport", 3="RDU", 4="91ZM", 5="Hauraki"]
     Selection item=Yamaha_Input mappings=[HDMI1="BlueRay",HDMI2="Satellite","NET RADIO"="NetRadio",TUNER="Tuner"]
     Selection item=Yamaha_Surround label="Surround Mode" mappings=["2ch Stereo"="2ch","7ch Stereo"="7ch"]
	 
	 # Although mappings/options are already defined for the channels, they are not shown in the current version of openhab2.
	 # For the moment, just define mappings in your sitemap files.

Hint: The tricky thing are the `"` around `NET RADIO`, this Key (left from the equal sign) is a value that must be send to the receiver **with** the space inside. If you omit the `"` the binding sends only the `NET` and the receiver do's nothing. 
Same are in surround definition!
